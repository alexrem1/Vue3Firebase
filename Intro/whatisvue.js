// Vue is a javascript and typescript framework for creating fast, reliable and interactive web apps and single page applications (SPA) eg all routing is done in the browser and not on the server

// SPAs
// only a single HTML page sent (initially) to the broswer
// vue intercepts subsequent requests and handles "page" changes in the browser by swapping what components are shown on the page
// results in a much faster smoother website experience

// Vue can be used for either standalone widgets, which we can drop into a website, or it can be used to create full websites

// widgets eg signup form, search bar etc - self contained inside this vue component allowing it be reused in many different places
