// Composition API - Improves on reusability, organization and readability by giving us a access to a setup() function inside of components

// We can now have MULTIPLE ROOT ELEMENTS for a component template eg elements side by side such as two divs. This reduces the amount of unnecesary HTML code

// Teleport component - render content from one component in a different place in the DOM eg modals

// Suspense component - used to handle asynchronous components easily and can provide fall-back content (eg a custom spinner) until data is loaded

// Typescript support.

// Multiple v-models for custom components, improved reactivity, performance gains
